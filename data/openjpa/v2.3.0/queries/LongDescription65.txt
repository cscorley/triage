The goal of this task is to change the packaging of the OpenJPA zip file so that the individual modules (openjpa-lib, openjpa-kernel, etc) are not included. The class files contained in the modules are already included in openjpa-all-$
{version}.jar. 

the task will also remove "all" from openjpa-all${version}
.jar in order to avoid confusion.
