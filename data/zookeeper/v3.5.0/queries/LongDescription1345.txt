I tried looking for an .gitignore file in the ZK sources but I could not find one.

Preferably, we could add one with the following:



#	.classpath
#	.eclipse/
#	.project
#	.revision/
#	.settings/
#	build/
#	src/c/generated/
#	src/java/generated/
#	src/java/lib/ant-eclipse-1.0-jvm1.2.jar
#	src/java/lib/ivy-2.2.0.jar



To avoid losing much when doing "git clean -fd" and the likes while cleaning up the working repo dirs during development. This will aid those who use git mirrors for contributions a lot.
