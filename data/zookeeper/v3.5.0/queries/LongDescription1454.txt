By default, the source distribution of cppunit is installed under /usr/local. When you run autoreconf -if, you get an error like this:



$ autoreconf -if
configure.ac:37: warning: macro `AM_PATH_CPPUNIT' not found in library
configure.ac:37: warning: macro `AM_PATH_CPPUNIT' not found in library
configure.ac:37: error: possibly undefined macro: AM_PATH_CPPUNIT
      If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow.
      See the Autoconf documentation.
autoreconf: /usr/local/bin/autoconf failed with exit status: 1



This is because cppunit.m4 is installed under /usr/local/share/aclocal, but aclocal only looks at /usr/share/aclocal-$VERSION and /usr/share/aclocal assuming it was configured with --prefix=/usr. There are 3 ways to specify additional paths.

1. Set ACLOCAL. 



ACLOCAL="aclocal -I /usr/local/share/aclocal" autoreconf -if 



2. Set ACLOCAL_PATH. 



ACLOCAL_PATH=/usr/local/share/aclocal autoreconf -if



3. Set ACLOCAL_FLAGS. 



ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I /usr/local/share/aclocal" autoreconf -if



Apparently older versions of autoreconf don't respect ACLOCAL_PATH or ACLOCAL_FLAGS, so using ACLOCAL is probably the best way to fix it. I'll update src/c/README to document this.
