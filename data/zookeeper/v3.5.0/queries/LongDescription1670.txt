We noticed this with jdk 1.6 where if no heap size is set the process takes up to 1/4 of mem available on the machine.

You can run the following command to see what are the defaults for your machine



java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version 2>&1 | grep -i -E 'heapsize|permsize|version'



And we noticed on two different class of machines that this was 1/4th of total memory on the machine.
