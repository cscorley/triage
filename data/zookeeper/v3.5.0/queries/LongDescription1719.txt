This fix from ZOOKEEPER-1663 is incorrect. It assumes the shell is bash since it uses bash array construction, e.g.:



 96   LIBPATH=("${ZOOKEEPER_PREFIX}"/share/zookeeper/*.jar)



This does NOT work if /bin/sh points to /bin/dash as it does on Ubuntu. 

It fails as so:


zkEnv.sh: 96: zkEnv.sh: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "fi")                                                                                                                                                                                              

If I change the shebang at the top to use "/bin/bash" instead of "/bin/sh" it works as expected. I don't know the full details of why using a bash array was chosen as the solution but I don't think it is the right way to deal with spaces in these paths...
