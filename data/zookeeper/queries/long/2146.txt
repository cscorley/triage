I recently observed a problem caused by malformed packets. ZK server crashed because of OutOfMemoryError.

The reason is BinaryInputArchive didn't check the length before allocating memory in readString():


  public String readString(String tag) throws IOException {
    	int len = in.readInt();
    	if (len == -1) return null;
    	byte b[] = new byte[len];
        ...



I suggest to add the same check as in readBuffer.
