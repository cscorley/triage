As discussed on the mailing list and suggested by Hoss:


 1) slap a special "@UnstableTest" annotation on them
 2) set up a new jenkins job that *only* runs these @UnstableTest jobs
 3) configure this new jenkins job to not send any email



Point 1 is trivial, 2 I have filed an issue for in the runner –
https://github.com/carrotsearch/randomizedtesting/issues/122
that I will take care of shortly.
