Its FaultyIndexInput is broken (doesn't implement seek/clone correctly).

This causes it to read bogus data and try to allocate an enormous byte[] for a term.

The bug was previously hidden:
FaultyDirectory doesnt override openSlice, so CFS must not be used at flush if you want to trigger the bug.
FailtyIndexInput's clone is broken, it uses "new" but doesn't seek the clone to the right place. This causes a disaster with BufferedIndexInput (which it extends), because BufferedIndexInput (not just the delegate) must "know" its position since it has seek-within-block etc code...

It seems with this test (very simple one), that only 3.x codec triggers it because its term dict relies upon clone()'s being seek'd to right place. 

I'm not sure what other codecs rely upon this, but imo we should also add a low-level test for directories that does something like this to ensure its really tested:



dir.createOutput(x);
dir.openInput(x);
input.seek(somewhere);
clone = input.clone();
assertEquals(somewhere, clone.getFilePointer());
