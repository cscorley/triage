We currently use the <script/> task to execute groovy script while building (SVN working copy tests, determining javadocs URL,...), which works perfectly fine.

The backside is that the groovy classpath is passed as separate classpath to ANT every time a <script/> task is executed. This leads to the problem that we get the usual ANT permgen problems, especially when we execute such tasks on sub.modules (we currently don't do this).

This is one reason why I did not yet port over the "svnversion" calls to svnkit, because its executed on every module. The license checker may have the same problem, once I port it over to be a simple groovy macro (see LUCENE-5210).

This patch uses the <groovy/> taskdef. The taskdef is only loaded once and can be inherited to subants.

There is currently one task/macro that does not use the <groovy/> task: pegdown, because its implemented as a <scriptfilter/>: It is used to filter the markdown and convert to HTML when copying the main web page. There is no replacement with groovy's taskdef unless I refactor it to not be a <filter/> inside a <copy/> task.
