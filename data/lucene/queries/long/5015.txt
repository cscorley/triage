I have an unexpected performance difference between the SamplingAccumulator and the StandardFacetAccumulator. 

The case is an index with about 5M documents and each document containing about 10 fields. I created a facet on each of those fields. When searching to retrieve facet-counts (using 1 CountFacetRequest), the SamplingAccumulator is about twice as fast as the StandardFacetAccumulator. This is expected and a nice speed-up. 

However, when I use more CountFacetRequests to retrieve facet-counts for more than one field, the speeds of the SampingAccumulator decreases, to the point where the StandardFacetAccumulator is faster. 


 
FacetRequests  Sampling    Standard
 1               391 ms     1100 ms
 2               531 ms     1095 ms 
 3               948 ms     1108 ms
 4              1400 ms     1110 ms
 5              1901 ms     1102 ms

 

Is this behaviour normal? I did not expect it, as the SamplingAccumulator needs to do less work? 

Some code to show what I do:



	searcher.search( facetsQuery, facetsCollector );
	final List<FacetResult> collectedFacets = facetsCollector.getFacetResults();






final FacetSearchParams facetSearchParams = new FacetSearchParams( facetRequests );

FacetsCollector facetsCollector;

if ( isSampled )
{
	facetsCollector =
		FacetsCollector.create( new SamplingAccumulator( new RandomSampler(), facetSearchParams, searcher.getIndexReader(), taxo ) );
}
else
{
	facetsCollector = FacetsCollector.create( FacetsAccumulator.create( facetSearchParams, searcher.getIndexReader(), taxo ) );
