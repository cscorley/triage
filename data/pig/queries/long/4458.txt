Right now, the MapSideMergeValidator outright rejects any foreach that has a UDF in it:



private boolean isAcceptableForEachOp(Operator lo) throws LogicalToPhysicalTranslatorException {
        if (lo instanceof LOForEach) {
            OperatorPlan innerPlan = ((LOForEach) lo).getInnerPlan();
            validateMapSideMerge(innerPlan.getSinks(), innerPlan);
            return !containsUDFs((LOForEach) lo);
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }




There is a TODO for this later on in that same class (inside containsUDFs):



// TODO (dvryaboy): in the future we could relax this rule by tracing what fields
// are being passed into the UDF, and only refusing if the UDF is working on the
// join key. Transforms of other fields should be ok.



We should do the TODO and relax this requirement or just remove it altogether
