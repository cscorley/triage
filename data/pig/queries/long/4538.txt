The following script fail:


in1 = LOAD 'data.txt' AS (ident:chararray);
in2 = LOAD 'data.txt' USING org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.CSVExcelStorage(',') AS (ident:chararray);
in3 = LOAD 'data.txt';
joined = JOIN in1 BY ident LEFT OUTER, in2 BY ident;
crossed = CROSS joined, in2;
DUMP crossed;


The second MR job fail with message:

ERROR 1070: Could not resolve org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.CSVExcelStorage using imports: [, java.lang., org.apache.pig.builtin., org.apache.pig.impl.builtin.]

This is a regression from Pig 0.13, possibly introduced by PIG-3591.
