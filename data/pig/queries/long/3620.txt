Here is a simplest example that reproduces the issue-
test.pig

a = LOAD 'foo' AS (x:int, y:chararray);
b = GROUP a BY x;
c = FOREACH b GENERATE a.x;
STORE c INTO 'c';
d = FOREACH b GENERATE a.y;
STORE d INTO 'd';


If you run pig -x tez_local -e 'explain -script test.pig', you will see two vertices that contains the following sub-plan- 


Tez vertex scope-27
# Plan on vertex
b: Local Rearrange[tuple]{int}(false) - scope-10
|   |
|   Project[int][0] - scope-11
|
|---a: New For Each(false,false)[bag] - scope-7
    |   |
    |   Cast[int] - scope-2
    |   |
    |   |---Project[bytearray][0] - scope-1
    |   |
    |   Cast[chararray] - scope-5
    |   |
    |   |---Project[bytearray][1] - scope-4
    |
    |---a: Load(file:///Users/cheolsoop/workspace/pig/foo:org.apache.pig.builtin.PigStorage) - scope-0


What's happening is that since there are 2 stores (and thus 2 data flows, i.e. a=>c and a=>d), Pig generates two physical plans. Now TezCompile compiles them into a single tez plan but adds the same sub-plan twice.

This is an issue with any blocking operators (join, union, etc) followed by split.
