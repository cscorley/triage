   When there are multiple levels of union, with the last union having both store and an output (group by,join, etc) following it then there is a NPE in 



if (succ.isVertexGroup()
                        && succ.getVertexGroupInfo().getOutput()
                                .equals(succOp.getOperatorKey().toString())) {
                    succOpVertexGroup = succ;
                    break;
                }



It should check for getOutput() != null as it now has a store vertexgroup
