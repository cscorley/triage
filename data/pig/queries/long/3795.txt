Let's say you have a query like this-


set default_parallel 200;
x = cogroup foo by a, bar by b parallel 10;
y = join x by c, z by d;


I would expect that cogroup has a parallel of 10 while join has a parallel of 200. However, the parallel of cogroup is also set to 200.

Here is where the default parallelism overwrites the user-specified parallelism.
TezCompiler.java#L390

        if (op.getRequestedParallelism() > curTezOp.getRequestedParallelism()) {
            curTezOp.setRequestedParallelism(op.getRequestedParallelism());
        }


In the above example, "op" is POLocalRearrange of join, and "curTezOp" is TezOperator that contains both POPackage of cogroup and POLocalRearrange of join.

Here is what the TezOperator looks like-


|   join_allocs_mop: Local Rearrange[tuple]{long}(false) - scope-134    ->   null
|   |   |
|   |   Project[long][10] - scope-135
|   |
|   |---join_allocs_subscrn: New For Each(true)[bag] - scope-75
|       |   |

|       |   |

|       |               |   Project[chararray][9] - scope-73
|       |               |
|       |               |---Project[bag][1] - scope-72
|       |
|       |---New For Each(false,false)[bag] - scope-66
|           |   |
|           |   Project[bag][1] - scope-62
|           |   |
|           |   Project[bag][2] - scope-64
|           |
|           |---abNonmemberByCustomer: Package(Packager)[tuple]{long} - scope-57


The problem is that the parallelism of root (POPackage) is overwritten by that of leaves (POLocalRearrange) because  the latter (200) > the former (10).
