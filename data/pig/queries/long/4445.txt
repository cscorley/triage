This was caused by a bug in the fix for PIG-4432.

To reproduce:

map_complex.txt

[a#(foo),b#(bar)]



testValueListComplex.pig

a = load 'map_complex.txt' as (map[(chararray)]);
b = foreach a generate VALUELIST($0);
describe b;



Expected:


b: {{((val_0: chararray))}}



Actual:


b: {{(val_0: chararray)}}
