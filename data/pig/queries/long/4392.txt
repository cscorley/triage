To reproduce:
input.txt

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9


rank.pig

set default_parallel 4;

d = load 'input.txt' using PigStorage(' ') as (a:int, b:int, c:int);
e = rank d by a;
dump e;


If default_parallel is set to 3, the script succeeds. So I'm guessing RANK BY has issues if the default_parallel exceeds the cardinality of the field being ranked by.

I'm seeing this issue with Pig 0.11.1 (which has the PIG-2932 patch applied) and Hadoop 2.3.0.
