The bin/pig script tries to load pig jar libraries from the pig-*-core.jar using this bash fragment




# for releases, add core pig to CLASSPATH
for f in $PIG_HOME/pig-*core.jar; do
    CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:$f;
done

# during development pig jar might be in build
for f in $PIG_HOME/build/pig-*-core.jar; do
    CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:$f;
done


 

The pig-*-core.jar does not contain the dependencies for pig that are found in build/ivy/lib/Pig/*.jar (jline).
The script does not even pick the pig.jar in PIG_HOME that is produced as a result of the ant build process.

This results in the following error after successfully building pig:


 

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: jline/ConsoleReaderInputStream
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: jline.ConsoleReaderInputStream
