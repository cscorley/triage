This is a side-effect of PIG-3584 that bumped avro version to 1.7.5.

The problem is that avro 1.7.5 pulls down jackson 1.9.9 jars as dependencies, and that makes TestRegisteredJarVisibility.testRegisterJarOverridePigJarPackages fail because the test case assumes that jackson 1.9.9 jars are not present in classpath.
