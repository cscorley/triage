The explicit mechanisms to start the network server make no mention of if they install a default security manager and policy or not.

These are at least:

NetworkServerControl javadoc
   summary - start command on command line
   main() method
   start() method

derby.drda.startNetworkServerProperty

Each start mechanism should clearly state if they install or do not install the default security manager and policy.

(Other starts commands are)

java -jar derbynet.jar
java -jar derbyrun.jar server start

I didn't look to see if these document the default policy or not, not sure where they are documented.
