If a client program does some operations using a ledger handle opened by openLedgerNoRecovery(), the program is not terminated after the handle and bookkeeper object is closed.

Here is a sample code. 


import java.util.Enumeration;

import org.apache.bookkeeper.client.BookKeeper;
import org.apache.bookkeeper.client.LedgerEntry;
import org.apache.bookkeeper.client.LedgerHandle;

public class BkClient {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      BookKeeper bk = new BookKeeper("localhost:2181");

      // 9 is a ledger id of an existing ledger
      LedgerHandle lh = bk.openLedgerNoRecovery(9, BookKeeper.DigestType.CRC32, "passwd".getBytes());

      Enumeration<LedgerEntry> entries = lh.readEntries(0, 0);

      lh.close();
      bk.close();
    } catch (Exception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}



Thread dump of this program shows that non-daemon thread "ZkLedgerManagerScheduler-0"  is alive, after bk.close() is called.
