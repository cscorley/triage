Review comment : Using AbstractFuture is too tight with guava's internal implementation. Instead it would be good to use a variable for the settable future.



 class Read... implements GenericCallback {

 SettableFuture future = ...;
  public void operationComplete(..) {
    future.set(null); 
    // future.setException(..)
  }
}
